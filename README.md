# dotfiles

### yet another dotfiles repo

this is not one of those "my dotfiles are here for your use" kind of repositories. this is more of a publicly accessible playground for me.

that said, if (by some strange, masochistic urge) you happen to find any use for what exists here, obviously feel free to take it for yourself to do with what you choose.

### usage

`GNU Stow` is now required. just clone the repo somewhere in your home directory (like `~/dotfiles`), cd into it, and run `stow *`. it should automatically link all files to their correct locations in `~/.config`
