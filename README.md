# dotfiles
yet another dotfiles repo

(NOTE: i'm not a developer, or a linux guru, or even that smart to begin with. i point this out because this repo will be filled with seemingly random, unintuitive, unhelpful, potentially downright confusing commits. this is because i don't know what the hell i'm doing. so, now that you're aware that i'm aware of how terrible i am at this, you won't need to remind me of it yourself, right?)
