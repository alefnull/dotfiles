# dotfiles
### yet another dotfiles repo
### (NOTE: this repo is now being managed locally as a bare git repo. for more info see [this write-up](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles))

this is not one of those "my dotfiles are here for your use" kind of repositories. this is more of a publicly accessible playground for me.

i'm not a developer by trade, but simply enjoy using the terminal for its own sake. so with that being said, this repo will be full of all kinds of silly, weird, random, mostly useless commits where i'm simply changing and playing around with things just because it's something i enjoy doing, in my spare time, for fun.

that said, if (by some strange, masochistic urge) you happen to find any use for what exists here, obviously feel free to take it for yourself to do with what you choose.

### "one-click" setup ([.config/scripts/install_dotfiles.sh](https://github.com/alefnull/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/scripts/install_dotfiles.sh))
